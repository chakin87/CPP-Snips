# A Git of Snips n Tricks - Use Responsibly! :P

## How To Use
There are several ways to use the repo. 
1) Browse through it on Github and find what you need.
2) Download any individual .cpp and run it in an IDE. This will print the examples and  
	give notes, along side of the examples, to as what is happening.
3) Copy and paste a specific function, lambda, algorithm, etc. and play around with it
	in an IDE


## Dependencies
Most of the cpps use a header 'functions.h' and it can be found in this repo along with
functions.cpp. I am going to refactor and clean up all cpps so that eventually they will
be able to be used seperately and entirely on there own. I want to use this approach so
that all of the functions used in that file can be found inside said file. This will 
add an all-in-one or self-contained feel to the repo. 

All of the code was written using MSVC and currently some of the cpps are using windows 
libs. I am going to eventually refactor all the code to make the code as cross-platform 
as I can. 


## Why?
I have created this repo for myself and friends as a reference for many of the powerful templates 
in the STL, keywords, functions, custom functions, and much more. I will continue to 
add to this repo when I have time. I use this Repo as a tool to reinforce what I learn and as 
a quick reference.

## More to Come!
I don't really know why, but my favorite repo to push to is this one. I have so many 
projects from years ago that I browse through when I have time and I will find good
snips and gems I add it to the matching cpp (or make a new cpp).
